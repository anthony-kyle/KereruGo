# Full Stack Boilerplate

## The Tech

A Boilerplate is already set up for you with everything you will need to get started. This boilerplate is set up to use:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)
* [Knex.js (SQL)](https://knexjs.org/)
* [Bulma (CSS framework)](https://bulma.io/documentation/)
* [JWT Auth (Local)](https://jwt.io/)

The Migration and seeds for the users table, and all login functionality is already set up!

The mobile responsiveness is also being handled by some neat JS and Bulma classes, be sure to incorporate that view in your project goals!


## Setup

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npx knex migrate:latest
npx knex seed:run
cp .env.example .env
```

To run in development:
```sh
npm run dev
```

To run in production:
```sh
npm start
```


## Heroku!!!

### Creating your app

Create your app with `heroku create [name]`

You can check that this was successful by running `heroku apps` to view a list of your apps


### Adding postgres

Add postgresql (hobby dev) to your app at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[APP NAME HERE]/resources`

Check that pg has been added by running `heroku addons` to ensure the postgresql db is on your app


### Deploying!

I have created several npm scripts that will be useful for deploying your app to heroku easily.

To push your local master branch to your heroku app:
```sh
npm run h:deploy
```

Run heroku migrations:
```sh
npm run h:migrate
```

Run heroku seeds:
```sh
npm run h:seed
```

If ever you need to rollback, you can also:
```sh
npm run h:rollback
```


### Ta-Da!
Your app should be deployed!
